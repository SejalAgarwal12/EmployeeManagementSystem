            employees or contractors, hence, we have crafted this Privacy Notice to provide our
            colleagues with clear, concise, and easy-to-read information about Nagarro and its 
            group companiesâ€™ privacy practices and how we collect, use, process, and transfer

        We have built our global privacy program based on our Intra Group Agreements (IGAs), 
        which serve as our global personal data transfer mechanism between Nagarro entities that 
        govern our global processing of personal data.
